# NASA_PROJECT..
This Project uses React on the Frontend and NodeJS on the backend to provide an interactive session that helps you maintain and access log of spaceships you have sent for exploration of planets that are potentially sutaible for life to exist.
The data of planets we used is from the data extracted from the official NASA website.
